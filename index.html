  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi, my name is Nathan Marsee! I'm a developer and game designer from Renton, Washington, and as you'd probably expect, my passions revolve primarily around video games. </p>
  <p>While I do enjoy playing games, I actually spend much more of my time analyzing the design of games, modifying my favorites, and creating games of my own. I've developed a handful of complete video games, most as personal projects, but I've also developed a full VR game for UW Medicine. I'm also made a card game called <i>Orbellion</i>, which I'm planning on expanding and adapting to an RPG video game in the near future.</p>
  <p>I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Eastern Washington University</p>

  <h2>My Interests</h2>
  <p>Though video games were what motivated me to pursue computer science in the first place, my interests do extend past them. The process of planning out a piece of software and solving the puzzle of implementing those plans is something I find incredibly engaging and fulfilling, no matter the purpose of the software. I also enjoy the more artistic parts of software creation like visual design and even music when applicable, though I'll admit neither of them are my strong suit</p>
  <p>Beyond software, I'm also passionate about storytelling. Experiencing the fictional worlds of others, or creating my own, I find the process of creating fiction super interesting. Creating and refining the worldbuilding of my own <i>Orbellion</i> project has been some of the most instructive and rewarding work I've done for a personal project.</p>
  <p>And of course, there are still a number of games I love playing and thinking about. For anyone curious, some of my favorite video games are <i>Elden Ring</i>, <i>Minecraft</i>, <i>Metroid Prime</i>, and <i>Undertale</i>. I also enjoy a number of physical games like <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i>, <i>Settlers of Catan</i>, and especially <i>Magic: the Gathering</i>, which I've been playing for nearly 13 years.</p>
